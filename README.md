Xrmtoolbox has made Dynamics CRM developer life easy.
I have created a plugin for Xrmtoolbox user.
With the help of this plugin:-

1. Download list of all security role.
2. User can see permission given in each security role to entity.
3. User can see Miscellaneous Privileges.
4. Export result in Excel.
